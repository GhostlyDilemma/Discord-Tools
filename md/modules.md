### Base Module {base_base}

<br/>

The base module is what the whole theme depends on, all the modules are built to work with this one, it has the most data in it and is the one with the most work put into it. If you really want to deselect it, remove it from the import statements.

### Root Module {base_root}

The second module that is needed for the theme. This one holds all the variables in one place and defines them there, you need to have this installed for 60% of the modules to work at all. If you want to define them in your own root section by yourself, go ahead, look at the source code and rewrite the root module to your liking.
